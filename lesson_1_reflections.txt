Q1: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I reviewed all the deleted and added files of the file and as I examined the added lines, 
I located a typo on line 6.

Q2: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It could make easier the debugging of a program, restore easily a file to it's previous version and 
reviewing all the changes that have been made on a file

Q3: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manual commit
	- Pros
		1) Programmer decides when to commit a file
		2) One commit per logical change
		3) Easily reviewing previous versions of a file using git log
	- Cons
		1) Sometimes too small or too big commits
		2) Forgetting about commiting a file

Automiatic save
	-Pros
		1) Never forget about commiting a file
	-Cons
		1) Always commiting small changes
		2) There are no logical commits
		3) Comparing different versions of a file sometimes has no point

Q4: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

By saving multiple files in one commit you can easily track the logical changes on your program, 
while by saving each file separately your files are always updated to the last version and there 
is no need for a manual commit

Q5: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

With git log you can view all the commits that have been made and with git diff you can view the differences in
two versions of a file on two different commits

Q6: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

In case something goes wrong we can checkout a previous commit and revert the files to its previous state

Q7: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

For tracking the different changes on my project, make the debbuging easier and not afraid to experiment 
by maikng changes to the project
