Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git folder is created insinde my reflections folder. We need to do it so we can make a repository for
our project and git can store in the .git folder all the metadata it needs for keep tracking all the different
versions of our project files.

Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

In the staging area you add the files you have changed temporarily, so later you can see in which files you have made 
changes and decide which files you want to add into the repository in a single commit.
